I recently bought an irrigation system to water the plants on my balcony. It worked perfectly, except that the small plant pots got too much water. The Drops Divider distributes the water evenly between two small pots, so they only get half the water. This not only works, but it also has a meditative character when you see the rocker tilting from side to side.



An alternative solution to the Drops Divider is [adjustable drippers](https://www.gardena.com/de/produkte/bewasserung/micro-drip-system/regulierbarer-endtropfer/900914801/). Instead of distributing the water of one [end dripper](https://www.gardena.com/de/produkte/bewasserung/micro-drip-system/endtropfer-druckausgleichend/901161001/), you can simply use two adjustable drippers. I hope you agree that Drops Divider solution is a lot more fun.



The direct material costs are approximately USD 4.



## Supplies

1 Gardena [end dripper](https://www.gardena.com/de/produkte/bewasserung/micro-drip-system/endtropfer-druckausgleichend/901161001/)

4 M2 x l10 mm flat headed screw

4 Wooden rod d5 x l260

4 Wooden rod d5 x l130

1 Paperclip d1

1 3D Printer

60 g PLA filament



Legend: l:length in millimeters, d:diameter in millimeters

## 3D Printed Parts

You can use PLA with 20% filling. If you don't have a 3D printer, I recommend looking for a 3D printing service nearby.



## Dripper Assembly

Insert the dripper into the opening provided and fix it with two M2 screws. Screw the other two screws into the holes in the two short legs. These two screws are used as fine adjustment screws.



## Seesaw Suspension

Use the four short wooden rods as spacers and the four long wooden rods as pillars to be stuck into the ground.



## Seesaw Assembly

Use a paperclip side piece on each side to secure the seesaw to the suspension.



That is the Drops Divider!
