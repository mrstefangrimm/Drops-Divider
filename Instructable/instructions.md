The Drops Divider is an addition to the Gardena Micro-Drip irrigation system. It ?distributes? the drops of a [end dripper](https://www.gardena.com/ch-de/produkte/bewasserung/micro-drip-system/endtropfer-druckausgleichend/901161101/) into two pots.





An alternative solution to the Drops Divider are [Gardena's adjustable drippers](https://www.gardena.com/ch-de/produkte/bewasserung/micro-drip-system/regulierbarer-endtropfer/900914901/).



I like plants. But I don't like watering the plants so I bought an irrigation system. With one little problem: The small pots get too much water.

The Drops Splitter equally distributes the water into two small pots; they now get half the water the medium sized pots get.

Besides the fact that it works, it has a meditative character watching the swing rock from side to side.

A drip is a small amount of liquid forming on lower side of something. A drop is a drip that has now fallen and hit something.
